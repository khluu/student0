Truc Vu|426|20|Truc works on part 1 and got it done earliest. After that, she helped us with part 3 as this is the most time consuming part. She has experience with using GDB so she gave me a lot of help on that. Debugging is very essential for this project so it was really helpful. Otherwise, I have no comment about her performance as she is always on time and does her job very greatly.  
Minh Nhat Nguyen|406|20|Nhat and I were basically pair programming on part 3 of this project. This part is definitely hard and takes so long. However, we did the best that we could. I appreciate his help on debugging and coding some parts of my share. We split up the part pretty evenly and he did his part on time. His code is also clean and easy to read, and he also tried to explain verbally the logic reasoning behind his code to me so that we are all caught up with the current codebase. Great work!
Vi Tran|527|20|Vi worked really well on the scheduler (task 2) part of the project. She was done with the part later, and went on to help us with task 3 for a bit. Otherwise, I didn't work on the scheduler part so I didn't really know much to comment. But her code is clean and easy to read, as later on I had to step in that part a little bit because something was conflicting with task 3. Her code was clean and easy to read. Just like Nhat, she also explained verbally to me. Good work!
