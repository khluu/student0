Truc Vu|426|20|Truc is amazing as she started working on the project the earliest in our group. The argument passing part that she is responsible for worked flawlessly. She also knows how to use GDB really well and helped a lot with debugging. I had a bit of struggle trying to understand her code, but it might just be my reading ability to be honest.
Minh Nhat Nguyen|406|20|Nhat is great on anything low-level related. Thus, he is mainly responsible for the FPU part of this project, which involves a lot of Assembly language reading. I still have no clue on what to do on the low-level side, so it is very fortunate that our team has someone such as Nhat to handle that part. His code is clean.
Vi Tran|527|20|Vi worked really well on the file operations part of the project. Her work and mine overlapped a little bit because we both used SYSCALL. It created a bit of conflict earlier because of the exit code printing and how our code overlapped. However, her communication skill to resolve the code conflicting is amazing as now our code is working just amazing. Her code is also very clean.
